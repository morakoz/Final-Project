## Question 1: 
What is a problem you’d like to solve using Data Analysis skills? Think of a question, problem, or transformation that includes a modern dataset that needs to be accessed via computational tools like those we’ve just started to explore. This could include exploratory work, or development of a specific kind of Reusable software element (like a calculation, transformation or modeling excercise):

    How do current pesticides being used by land owners affect the amphibian pathogens in nearby water sources?

## Question 2: 
What kind of computational steps do you think this project would entail. At the least, describe in words a few things you think you woudl need to do. Better - sketch out an ‘outline’ for a Python project that woudl accomplish these steps. You can refer to simular skills outlined above.

    I will need to go through the data and figure out what I need to anwser my question. Make tables for the data. Turn the data into graphs using python and other coding sites.

## Question 3: 
What kind of data woudl you use? Be specific here. Is there a data object type that you know you’d be working with? Are you working with a specific data set, if so, what is the data source? What format does the data come in and how do you access it?

    The data comes in a table that i can use and filter through. The data gives the amount of each pesticide found in nearby water sources. I can take the numbers and make graphs with them. I can also take the data from the amphibians and compare the  pathogens in the amphibians and the pesticides in the water to figure out what is affecting the amphibians the most.
